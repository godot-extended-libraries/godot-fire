"A* (A star) is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and "
"graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices "
"(points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys "
"widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* "
"implementation uses points in three-dimensional space and Euclidean "
"distances by default.\n"
"You must add points manually with [method add_point] and create segments "
"manually with [method connect_points]. Then you can test if there is a path "
"between two points with the [method are_points_connected] function, get a "
"path containing indices by [method get_id_path], or one containing actual "
"coordinates with [method get_point_path].\n"
"It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class "
"that extends [code]AStar[/code] and override methods [method _compute_cost] "

"Dictionary type. Associative container which contains values referenced by "
"unique keys. Dictionaries are composed of pairs of keys (which must be "
"unique) and values. Dictionaries will preserve the insertion order when "
"adding elements, even though this may not be reflected when printing the "
"dictionary. In other programming languages, this data structure is sometimes "
"referred to as an hash map or associative array.\n"
"You can define a dictionary by placing a comma-separated list of [code]key: "
"value[/code] pairs in curly braces [code]{}[/code].\n"
"Erasing elements while iterating over them [b]is not supported[/b] and will "
"result in undefined behavior.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Dictionaries are always passed by reference. To get a copy of a "
"dictionary which can be modified independently of the original dictionary, "
"use [method duplicate].\n"
"Creating a dictionary:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var my_dir = {} # Creates an empty dictionary.\n"
"var points_dir = {\"White\": 50, \"Yellow\": 75, \"Orange\": 100}\n"
"var another_dir = {\n"
"    key1: value1,\n"
"    key2: value2,\n"
"    key3: value3,\n"
"}\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"You can access a dictionary's values by referencing the appropriate key. In "
"the above example, [code]points_dir[\"White\"][/code] will return [code]50[/"
"code]. You can also write [code]points_dir.White[/code], which is "
"equivalent. However, you'll have to use the bracket syntax if the key you're "
"accessing the dictionary with isn't a fixed string (such as a number or "
"variable).\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"export(String, \"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Orange\") var my_color\n"
"var points_dir = {\"White\": 50, \"Yellow\": 75, \"Orange\": 100}\n"
"\n"
"func _ready():\n"
"    # We can't use dot syntax here as `my_color` is a variable.\n"
"    var points = points_dir[my_color]\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"In the above code, [code]points[/code] will be assigned the value that is "
"paired with the appropriate color selected in [code]my_color[/code].\n"
"Dictionaries can contain more complex data:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"my_dir = {\"First Array\": [1, 2, 3, 4]} # Assigns an Array to a String "
"key.\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"To add a key to an existing dictionary, access it like an existing key and "
"assign to it:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var points_dir = {\"White\": 50, \"Yellow\": 75, \"Orange\": 100}\n"
"points_dir[\"Blue\"] = 150 # Add \"Blue\" as a key and assign 150 as its "
"value.\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Finally, dictionaries can contain different types of keys and values in the "
"same dictionary:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"# This is a valid dictionary.\n"
"# To access the string \"Nested value\" below, use `my_dir.sub_dir.sub_key` "
"or `my_dir[\"sub_dir\"][\"sub_key\"]`.\n"
"# Indexing styles can be mixed and matched depending on your needs.\n"
"var my_dir = {\n"
"    \"String Key\": 5,\n"
"    4: [1, 2, 3],\n"
"    7: \"Hello\",\n"
"    \"sub_dir\": {\"sub_key\": \"Nested value\"},\n"
"}\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Unlike [Array]s, you can't compare dictionaries directly:\n"

"Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of "
"another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any "
"number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct "
"children of a node) should have unique names.\n"
"A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk "
"and then instanced into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility "
"in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.\n"
"[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a "
"node is added to the scene tree, it receives the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback "
"is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i."
"e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered "
"before its child's.\n"
"Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_READY] notification and their respective [method _ready] "
"callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback "
"is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the "
"parent nodes.\n"
"This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order "
"will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method "
"_enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally "
"[method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).\n"
"[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the \"process\" state, so that they "
"receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). "
"Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method "
"set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame "
"rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] is passed as an argument. Physics "
"processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled with [method "
"set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by "
"default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.\n"
"Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] "
"function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many "
"cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the "
"[method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the "
"input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), "
"ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.\n"
"To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into "
"other scenes), an \"owner\" can be set for the node with the [member owner] "
"property. This keeps track of who instanced what. This is mostly useful when "
"writing editors and tools, though.\n"
"Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method "
"queue_free], it will also free all its children.\n"
"[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy "
"to manage, you could create groups like \"enemies\" or \"collectables\" for "
"example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method "
"is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes "
"in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the "
"methods on [SceneTree].\n"
"[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, "
"see [NetworkedMultiplayerENet]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC "
"(remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling "
"[method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all "
"connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). "
"To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] "
"(make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the "
"high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos."

"A unit quaternion used for representing 3D rotations. Quaternions need to be "

"It is similar to Basis, which implements matrix representation of rotations, "

"stores rotation, scale, and shearing, while Quat only stores rotation.\n"
"Due to its compactness and the way it is stored in memory, certain "

"A regular expression (or regex) is a compact language that can be used to "
"recognise strings that follow a specific pattern, such as URLs, email "
"addresses, complete sentences, etc. For instance, a regex of [code]ab[0-9][/"
"code] would find any string that is [code]ab[/code] followed by any number "
"from [code]0[/code] to [code]9[/code]. For a more in-depth look, you can "
"easily find various tutorials and detailed explanations on the Internet.\n"
"To begin, the RegEx object needs to be compiled with the search pattern "
"using [method compile] before it can be used.\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var regex = RegEx.new()\n"
"regex.compile(\"\\\\w-(\\\\d+)\")\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"The search pattern must be escaped first for GDScript before it is escaped "
"for the expression. For example, [code]compile(\"\\\\d+\")[/code] would be "
"read by RegEx as [code]\\d+[/code]. Similarly, [code]compile(\"\\\"(?:\\\\\\"
"\\.|[^\\\"])*\\\"\")[/code] would be read as [code]\"(?:\\\\.|[^\"])*\"[/"
"code].\n"
"Using [method search], you can find the pattern within the given text. If a "
"pattern is found, [RegExMatch] is returned and you can retrieve details of "

"RegExMatch.get_start].\n"

"The results of capturing groups [code]()[/code] can be retrieved by passing "
"the group number to the various methods in [RegExMatch]. Group 0 is the "
"default and will always refer to the entire pattern. In the above example, "
"calling [code]result.get_string(1)[/code] would give you [code]0123[/code].\n"
"This version of RegEx also supports named capturing groups, and the names "
"can be used to retrieve the results. If two or more groups have the same "
"name, the name would only refer to the first one with a match.\n"

"    print(result.get_string(\"digit\")) # Would print 2f\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"If you need to process multiple results, [method search_all] generates a "
"list of all non-overlapping results. This can be combined with a [code]for[/"
"code] loop for convenience.\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"for result in regex.search_all(\"d01, d03, d0c, x3f and x42\"):\n"

"The [SurfaceTool] is used to construct a [Mesh] by specifying vertex "

"[codeblock]\n"
"var st = SurfaceTool.new()\n"
"st.begin(Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES)\n"

"Vertex attributes must be passed [b]before[/b] calling [method add_vertex]. "
"Failure to do so will result in an error when committing the vertex "

"Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be "
"interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-"
"betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] "
"and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.\n"
"[Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't "
"know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-"
"chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween] node; it would be "
"difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node.\n"
"Here is a brief usage example that makes a 2D node move smoothly between two "
"positions:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_node(\"Tween\")\n"
"tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, \"position\",\n"
"        Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,\n"
"        Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)\n"
"tween.start()\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Many methods require a property name, such as [code]\"position\"[/code] "
"above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property "
"in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly "
"by using [code]\"property:component\"[/code] (eg. [code]position:x[/code]), "
"where it would only apply to that particular component.\n"
"Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/"
"code]. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to "
"the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings."
"net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum "
"EaseType] constant, and controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is "
"applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you "
"don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum "
"TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that "
"looks best.\n"

"- Can be used to convert safely between datatypes.\n"

"- Can be used to defer calls or move data between threads.\n"
"- Can be serialized as binary and stored to disk, or transferred via "
