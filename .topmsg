Subject: [PATCH] extended/crash-report
Add a crash reporter that sends to breakpad.

* Add a function that will crash the engine.
* Add Breakpad project config variables for the server and handler location.
* Add video adapter name, Godot version and product name to be sent as annotations.
* Move defaults to project settings and use globalize_path.
* Add Google's crashpad to thirdparty folder.
* Add a confirmation dialog to Crashpad crash report uploading.
* If the handler or url config is empty, do nothing.
* Use a global static variable to disable crash reporting because the crash exception handler is a static function.
* Create scons options for crashpad_url and crashpad_handler_path
* Split crashpad settings into project and editor ones and have a clearly labelled offswitch.
