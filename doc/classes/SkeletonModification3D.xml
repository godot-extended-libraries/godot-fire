		A resource that operates on bones in a [Skeleton3D].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This resource provides an interface that can be expanded so code that operates on bones in a [Skeleton3D] can be mixed and matched together to create complex interactions.
		This is used to provide Godot with a flexible and powerful Inverse Kinematics solution that can be adapted for many different uses.

		<method name="setup_modification" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<description>
				Sets up the modification so it can be executed. This function should be called automatically by the [SkeletonModificationStack3D] containing this modification.
